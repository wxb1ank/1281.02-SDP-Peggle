# ~The Peggle Makefile~
# Author: Will Blankemeyer

# Note: I have only tested this on Windows so it may fail on *nix-based platforms.
#
# Note: For brevity, "simulator" is shorthand for "FEH Proteus simulator", and "simulator repo" is
#       shorthand for "simulator Git repository".
#
# Note: The Makefile language is a Turing tarpit. Among other shortcomings, it lacks an obvious type
#       system. For the convenience of the reader, all variables have been annotated with a
#       *quot*[1] `::` followed by a tag that categorizes the information contained within. The full
#       list of variable tags used in this Makefile is given below:
#		  - text
#				A generic string that does not contain whitespace.
#   	  - rel-path
#				A type of `text` that represents a filesystem path relative to the current
#				directory.
#   	  - exe
#				A type of `text` that represents the name of an executable program accessible from a
#				shell.
#  	      - A -> B
#				A Makefile function that receives an argument of type `A` and returns type `B`.
#         - [A]
#				A list of type `A`.
#
# [1]: I think Jake came up with the name. In this context, `::` is read *has type*. I stole this
#      interpretation from Haskell.
